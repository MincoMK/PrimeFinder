# PrimeFinder
Prime finder by. Minco  
The C++ code of finder is not mine ([The original]()), I modified it little.

## The URL of result.txt
I uploaded result.txt in my server because it's too large.  
You can download it [here](https://www.minco.kro.kr/dumps/prime/result.txt). (**Do not visit this in browser! Your browser will stop immediately!**)  

The example (JavaScript)
```js
var data = <The string data of result.txt file>
data = data.split(" ").map(Number);
```
  
// > data [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ...]
